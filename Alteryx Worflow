We are building a multiple linear regression model with the first data set(diamonds.csv). It contains 50,000 observations 5 variables including the price variable
That is, Price = B0 + B1carat + B2cut + B3colour + B4clarity
You can check out my Alteryx workflow file which is uploaded in this repository
We would then make price predictions on the second dataset (new diamonds.csv). It has 3000 observations and 4 variables excluding the price variable. 
After making price predictions on each observation in the second dataset, we would sum it up and calculate 70% of it in order to make a bidding price
recommendation for our Jewelry Company
My predicted price was $11,764,788.643528, this prediction reflects the price at which 3000 diamonds would be sold to the final consumer
but since the company generally purchases diamonds from distributors at 70% of the typical price predictions, 
I will make a recommendation of $8,235,352 as the bidding price.
