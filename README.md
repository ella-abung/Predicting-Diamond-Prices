# Predicting-Diamond-Prices
A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but isn't sure how much it should bid. 
This project uses an existing dataset of diamonds to build a Linear regression model which makes predictions of diamond prices based on the features of the diamond such as it's carat, cut, colour etc. 
When this is done, we would be able to make suggestions with empirical backing on how much the Jewelry company should bid for the diamonds it wants to purchase.
The tool in use is Alteryx.
Below are some questions we need to answer in order to properly understand the problem we have at hand
1) What decisions need to be made?
Ans: The amount to bid for the 3000 diamonds offered by the diamond distributor.
2) What information is needed to inform that decision?
Ans: The amount which diamonds with certain features are usually sold for
3) What type of analysis is needed to get the information needed to make that decision?
Ans: To get the information we need we would use predictive analysis, specifically Linear Regression. This is because the variable we are trying to predict is a continuous and numeric one.(A continuous variable is one that can take on all values in a range).
Now we need to investigate the data we need to solve our problem
1) Are we Data Rich or Data Poor, that is, do we have enough data on what we are trying to predict? In this case, the prices of diamonds 
Ans: Yes!
